{"name":"Libcap-ng","tagline":"Mirror http://svn.fedorahosted.org/svn/libcap-ng","body":"The libcap-ng library should make programming with posix capabilities\r\neasier. The library has some utilities to help you analyse a system\r\nfor apps that may have too much privileges.\r\n\r\nNOTE: to distributions. There is a \"make check\" target. It only works\r\nif the headers match the kernel. IOW, if you have a chroot build system\r\nthat is using a much older kernel, the macros in the kernel header files\r\nwill do the wrong thing when the capng_init function probes the kernel\r\nand decides we are doing v1 rather than v3 protocol. If that is your case,\r\njust don't do the \"make check\" as part of the build process.\r\n\r\nReport any bugs in this package to  sgrubb@redhat.com  or better yet,\r\nfile them here: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
